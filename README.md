# Word-Guessing-Game-in-Python
A simple word guessing game using basic Python concepts, and Tkinter GUI Application

You might all have played the word guessing game when you were a kid. This is an excellent way for parents to encourage their children to learn and have fun at the same time.  This nostalgia led us to build a word guessing game using Python functionalities.
It works in your browser, and it’s pretty simple: guess a word, and the software will tell you if you are guessing it correctly. Sounds easy, right?
Haha! Just kidding! It’s actually surprisingly hard and will make you realize how rusty you are at reciting the alphabet in your head. The game offers a “normal” and “hard” word to try. You can go until you win, or give up like a quitter and come back to play again. You can even play the game with a friend.

### GOAL:
To utilize the basic concepts of Python like lists, file handling, functions etc learnt and use them to build a simple real-life project.
